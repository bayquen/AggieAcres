## HackDavis 2024 Project 
### By Yu, Jhaydine, Ethan, and Brandon

Our web application, AggieAcres, is tailored to meet the needs of UC Davis students and potential residents. It simplifies the process of finding suitable apartments and homes for rent, catering to their budget and preferences.

## Overview
Many students wish to move out of dorms after their first year but struggle with the current housing search tools. Traditional methods require checking multiple websites and making complex comparisons. AggieAcres addresses this by providing a streamlined, user-friendly platform where students can specify their needs and instantly receive tailored housing options.

## Features
- **User Input Interface**: Collect user preferences through a simple web form.
- **Data Aggregation**: Aggregate housing data from multiple sources like Zillow and House Rental.
- **Smart Analysis**: Utilize INTEL CLOUD API for intelligent parsing and recommendation of housing options.

## Technology Stack
- **Front-end**: Developed using HTML and Spring Boot for dynamic web pages.
- **Back-end**: Python server scripts to fetch and process data from various APIs.
- **API Integration**: INTEL CLOUD API for data interpretation and analysis.

## How It Works
1. **User Submission**: Users input their preferences directly on the website.
2. **Data Processing**: Backend scripts fetch and analyze data from over 10 sources.
3. **Results Display**: The best housing options are displayed, ranked by suitability factors like price, location, and commute time.
